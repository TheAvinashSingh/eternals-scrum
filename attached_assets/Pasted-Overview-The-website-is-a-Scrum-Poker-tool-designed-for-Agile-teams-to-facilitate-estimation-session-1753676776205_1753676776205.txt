User Journey and Functionality
Homepage:
	•	Clearly describes Scrum Poker with instructions for new users.
	•	Two primary CTAs:
	◦	Host a Session: Initiates creating a new session.
	◦	Join a Session: Users can enter a session by inputting a 4-digit session code.
Hosting a Session:
	•	The host clicks "Host a Session," sets a unique 4-digit PIN code, and clicks "Create."
	•	Upon creation, a unique session URL is generated (format: website.com/poker/{randomCode}), displayed prominently at the top for easy sharing.
	•	Host interface allows:
	◦	Viewing the list of active participants.
	◦	Removing participants from the session.
	◦	Defining visibility settings for votes (toggle to show/hide until revealed).
	◦	Choosing available card values from options: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, coffee, ?
Joining a Session:
	•	Participants use the session link provided by the host or manually enter the 4-digit PIN on the homepage.
	•	Upon joining, users enter their name, which is then displayed in real-time to all session participants.
	•	Participants have the option to leave the session voluntarily.
Voting Process:
	1	Host initiates voting by entering a descriptive label for the voting round (e.g., "Story #12: Login Feature") and clicks "Start Voting."
	2	All participants select a card privately from the provided options.
	3	Users can change their selected card until votes are revealed.
	4	The host can manually click "Show Votes" at any time, flipping all participant cards simultaneously.
	5	Once votes are revealed:
	◦	Individual user votes are displayed clearly next to usernames.
	◦	The average numeric value is calculated and displayed (excluding non-numeric votes such as "coffee" or "?").
	◦	A count summary of votes (e.g., how many users voted each specific number or card type) is displayed.
	6	Host can click "Reset Votes" to reinitiate the voting round or start a new round by entering a new label.
UI Layout:
